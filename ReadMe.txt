All done except donation suggestions, the donation is done automatically.
To you can changhe local PC date to play with dates. The notifications regarding too high burdown rates along with the suggestion to donate are sent to the user when the he logs in successfully.
I considered that you can eat or donate an expired item. Maybe it can be donated as animal food and you can eat whatever you want.
I tried to keep it as loosely coupled as possible, and to make functions as single-purpose as possible. But always due to complications the classes start to get heavy and splitting them is nearly impossible. I will try to improve for the future!
Sorry for the delay, it ttok me a while to get used to java again.
  Best wishes,
